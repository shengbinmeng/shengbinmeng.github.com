今年4月份的时候，[Google+](https://plus.google.com/)对普通用户关闭了。当时我收到了让我导出数据的邮件，也照做了，不过没太仔细了解。
现在回头去看，发现我在上面还发了不少帖子，就干脆整理一下放在这里。

下面都是我发的带图片的原创内容（按照发布时间排序），也算作对自己数据的备份保留吧。文字原本就是用英语写的，直接贴过来了。

What a big cover picture!

Open my MacBook Pro to update memory.

Run, Mountain Lion, run!

This is as much as it can be.

Chromebook is good. It would be better if all of Google's service can be well used here in China.

It's not so easy to move from one Mac to another, even they provide tools such as Migration Assistant. The Top 25 Most Played songs list of my iTunes will very likely be lost.

iPhone 5c, c for colors. And for the first time China is among the first launching countries.

Windows 8.1 supports Retina display! So I decided to install it as a second system on my MacBook.

**2013-10-23：**

Mavericks installed, latest version of OS X. I enjoy the newly added iBooks and the new Dictionary.

**2013-11-20：**

OK, I suddenly realize this is a show time (when I just bought several iOS devices to test apps).

The Colosseum in Rome. This picture, which seems good if not excellent, is taken using my iPhone 4s.

Hello, OS X 10.10 Yosemite! (It looks great.)

**2014-11-20：**

They say you should keep your inbox empty. So be it.

![](/images/2019-07-18-google-plus-18.png)

Also keep the emails bundled and make them all Done. So that's it.

Into the time of Wearable.

**2015-03-04：**

I never thought I would need to buy this god damn thing, which costs nearly 600 RMB!

It feels good to complete a CLI game. The game is called Hack RUN and can be downloaded at http://i273.com/default.aspx.

**2015-05-22：**

Another product from Xiaomi. I buy it because I think it's cheap and cool (OK, "cool" means "useful").

**2015-06-02：**

Since when Microsoft becomes this style?

**2015-07-08：**

It is time - trying out the Apple Watch.

Bought a Sony Walkman Sport MP3 player. It's waterproof so I can listen to my music when I swim. I bought it in Japan with the tax-free price. Ha!

We don't need Siri to have a hint: the picture on top clearly indicates ForceTouch.

**2015-09-02：**

All the devices I have bought. Take a photo of the packages before I throw them all. Throw the packages, I mean.

The size of Mac mini is NOT as mini as I think.

Wow, this guy had some real support, man. (See the text with blue underline.)

**2015-12-30：**

Say bye bye to the old Medium profile page (https://medium.com/@shengbinmeng). I kind of like it.

![](/images/2019-07-18-google-plus-34.png)

Let's also remember the old Google+ profile page.

I think Apple lowers itself with this kind of old little trick.

When tech people are joking, they are really serious! I like the sense of humor here. (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

No, I didn't mean Oscars. Who cares about those film awards?

趁此也怀念一下当时那意气风发的年轻岁月。

> 天下风云出我辈，一入江湖岁月催。
> 皇图霸业谈笑中，不胜人生一场醉。
> 提剑跨骑挥鬼雨，白骨如山鸟惊飞。
> 尘事如潮人如水，只叹江湖几人回。
