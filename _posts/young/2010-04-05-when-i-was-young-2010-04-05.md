	I never stop fighting for my way; 
	I also spare time enjoying the stay. 
	You are the blue birds of spring days, 
	Little wings shining pretty in my eyes. 

	I know you keep trying to fly, 
	So I may feel sorry to hug you in the arms of mine. 
	Though distance exists between you and I, 
	My heart always goes on. 

	And passion for you just goes high; 
	It seems never, never, never down. 
	Night after night and day after day, 
	Why this feeling can’t just fade away… 

	Who can tell the secrets of love? 
	Who is the designer of life? 
	Things change easily in the long river of time, 
	I, with you, have this very romantic dream.
